# Question

Suppose you have an app that sells phones being served at `www.phones.com`. To view a single phone's details, the user navigates to the URL `www.phones.com/phones/5` where the number `5` is the id of a particular phone.

Using React Router, there is a corresponding route defined to render the `PhoneDetails` component:

```jsx
<Route path="/phones/:phoneId" element={<PhoneDetails />} />
```

Within the `PhoneDetails` component, `useParams` extracts the value of the `phoneId` path parameter (`5`) from the URL `www.phones.com/phones/5`

```jsx
const PhoneDetails = () => {
  const { phoneId } = useParams();
  
  // code to render the phone details
}
```

What is the data type of `phoneId`?

# Answer
`phoneId` is a string. We likely parsed it to a string somewhere else in the code so that we could use it as a url path.

# Feedback

We should parse it however it is typically not parsed due to the fact that string + num in js will result in a string due to concatenation!
When we pull the id from the string however, it is a common practice to convert it to a number because most of the time we will be comparing it to the value we have saved and that value is usually a number!
