# Question

With React Router, which of the following path(s) will match the `/products/:id` path?

1. `/products`
2. `/products/apple`
3. `/products/5`
4. `/products/5/about`

Explain your answer.

# Answer
Number 3 `/products/5` will match the `/products/:id` path because `:id` is a dynamic segment that can match any value. It technically could also match `/products/apple`, but `:id` is typically a number so this is unlikely.



# Feedback

It will match both the 2nd and 3rd routes unless there is a specific route called `/products/apple`!
