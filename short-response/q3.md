# Question

When is it appropriate to use the `"*"` path for a `Route` in React Router?

# Answer
We use the wildcard path for a `Route` when we want to have a fallback component. If the page the user attempts to get to does not exist, the wildcard route will get triggered and display our fallback component (typically a "Page not found" message.)
